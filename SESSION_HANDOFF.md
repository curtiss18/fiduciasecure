# Session Handoff - May 23, 2025

## Where We Left Off
Just completed the entire advisor profile system including:
- Multi-state registration with custom MultiSelect component
- Comprehensive profile editing in a modal
- Full dashboard redesign with cards layout
- Complete UI component library foundation
- All TypeScript/ESLint errors resolved
- Documentation system created

## Ready for Next Session
The **clients table** is the next priority. The database design is complete and ready to implement:

```sql
clients {
  id: uuid (PK)
  advisor_id: uuid (FK to advisor_profiles)
  client_number: text (unique, auto-generated)
  client_type: enum ('individual', 'joint')
  status: enum ('prospect', 'onboarding', 'active', 'inactive')
  onboarding_stage: enum
  primary_contact_id: uuid (FK to contacts)
  filing_status: enum
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
}
```

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Create clients table with RLS
2. Build useClients hook
3. Create "Add Client" modal/form
4. Build client list view for dashboard
5. Implement client detail page

## Technical Notes
- All imports are working correctly
- Supabase client is set up with proper typing
- Modal system is ready for reuse
- Form components are battle-tested
- Database migration pattern is established

## No Outstanding Issues
- Build completes successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- All components tested and working
- Documentation is current

Perfect state to start implementing the client management system!
