# Session Handoff - May 26, 2025

## Major Changes Made This Session

### 🔄 **Architecture Restructure: Independent Representatives**
**Problem Solved**: Originally designed advisor-profiles as primary entities, but realized representatives should be the primary users who can work independently.

**New Architecture**:
```
Advisors (optional firms) 
└── Representatives (primary users - can be independent)
    └── Clients 
        └── Contacts
```

### 📋 **Database Changes Applied**
1. **Renamed** `advisor_profiles` → `representatives`
2. **Created** new `advisors` table for optional firm entities
3. **Added** `advisor_id` to representatives (nullable - supports independence)
4. **Restored** `firm_name` to representatives for independent users
5. **Updated** all RLS policies and indexes

### 🛠 **Code Updates Completed**
1. **TypeScript types** updated with new interfaces and helper functions
2. **Dashboard UI** now shows "Practice" vs "Firm" with independence indicators
3. **Profile editing** intelligently handles independent vs advisor-linked reps
4. **Database hooks** support both old and new table structures during migration
5. **Import statements** fixed for proper function imports

### 📊 **Data Migration Status**
- ✅ Representatives table created and populated
- ✅ Advisors table created with "Institute for Wealth Management"
- ✅ Both test representatives linked to the advisor
- ✅ Independent representative functionality tested and working

## Current Capabilities

### ✅ **Working Features**
- **Authentication**: User signup/login with automatic profile creation
- **Independent Representatives**: Can manage their own firm information
- **Advisor-linked Representatives**: Inherit firm info from advisors table
- **Adaptive Dashboard**: Shows appropriate labels and badges
- **Profile Management**: Intelligent form handling based on rep type
- **No Build Errors**: All TypeScript and linting issues resolved
### 🎯 **User Experience**
- Representatives can start using the platform immediately (no firm required)
- Clear visual indicators show independence status
- Profile editing works correctly for both rep types
- Smooth onboarding for new independent representatives

## Ready for Next Session

### 🎯 **Immediate Priority: Clients Table**
The clients table design needs updating to link to `representatives` instead of `advisors`:

```sql
clients {
  id: uuid (PK)
  representative_id: uuid (FK to representatives) -- Updated
  client_number: text (unique, auto-generated)
  client_type: enum ('individual', 'joint')
  status: enum ('prospect', 'onboarding', 'active', 'inactive')
  -- ... rest of fields
}
```

### 📁 **Files Updated This Session**
- `migrations/representatives-migration.sql` - Main restructure
- `migrations/insert-advisor-data.sql` - Test data
- `migrations/support-independent-representatives.sql` - Independence support
- `src/types/database.types.ts` - Updated interfaces and helpers
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - UI and logic updates
- `src/hooks/useAdvisorProfile.ts` - Table compatibility
- `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Architecture documentation
- `CURRENT_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql` - Schema state
- `CONTEXT_PROMPT.md` - Updated context

### 🔄 **Next Steps Recommended**
1. **Update clients table design** to use representative_id
2. **Create clients migration** with proper relationships
3. **Build useClients hook** following representative pattern
4. **Create "Add Client" functionality** on dashboard
5. **Implement client list/grid views**

## Technical Notes for Next Developer

### 🏗 **Architecture Principles Established**
- **Representatives are primary users** - they control their data
- **Advisors are optional containers** - provide firm-level organization
- **Flexible relationships** - reps can be independent or advisor-linked
- **Smart UI adaptation** - shows appropriate controls based on rep type

### 🔒 **Security Considerations**
- All RLS policies updated for new structure
- Representatives only see their own data
- Advisor data accessible only to linked representatives
- Proper audit trails maintained

### 🧪 **Testing Status**
- ✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Authentication flow working
- ✅ Profile editing working for both rep types
- ✅ Database migrations applied successfully
- ✅ UI displays correctly with independence indicators

## Environment Status
- **Development server**: Can be started with `npm run dev`
- **Database**: Fully migrated and tested
- **No outstanding issues**: Ready for feature development

Perfect foundation for implementing client management system!
